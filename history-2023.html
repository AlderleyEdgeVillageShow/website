        <p>What an incredible day the re-launch of the Alderley Village Show turned out to be!  With over 300 exhibits, from giant pumpkins to novelty tea cosies a good time was had by all!</p>

            <p>The Festival Hall opened at mid-day & was the perfect venue for the Show.  With an entrance table groaning under the weight of breads, cakes, jams & preserves, visitors flowed through the door, to admire fruit, veg & flower displays & the stunning crafts including  ceramics, painting, photography, embroidery, clock making, card making, quilting, knitting,  painting  & so much more - even a fabulously woven hat.</p>

            <p>The café was kept busy throughout with cream teas & homemade cakes & was the perfect hub for old faces & new to catch-up.  It was good to welcome those visiting a village show for the first time, (some from afar as Spain & South Africa), an experience they enjoyed so much that some even volunteered to help next year with others already planning their entries for the next Show!</p>

            <p>WINNERS: 22 trophies were awarded in total. Kelvin Briggs won the Peet Percival Memorial Shield for the best horticultural exhibit in the show, as well as the Stockport Express Silver Trophy for best horticultural exhibit with a 3 mile radius for his 3 stunning leeks.   Our other winners were: Colin Mills (3 cups: for the best dahlia, 3 kinds of veg & highest aggregate points in veg class), Jenny Grimes (2 cups: 8 shallots & highest aggregate points in flower class ), Alan Grace (2 cups: 6 dressed onions & 8 runner beans ), Luke Ellis (2 cups: heaviest marrow & heaviest pumpkin), Ian Cockshot (5 decorative  dahlias),  Alex Lashford (highest aggregate points in Newcomers class)  Dina Robinson (most meritorious exhibit in domestic crafts),  Sue Mills (highest aggregate points in handicrafts), Alan Beecham (Best exhibit in handicraft),   Jenny Cockshott (highest aggregate points in cookery) , Freddie & Florence Robinson-Pickles (tallest sunflower), Jace Beecham (animal made from fruit/veg), Diana Bullock (highest aggregate points in jams, pickles & preserves), Elaine Ockelton (best bread exhibit in show), Simon Laidler (best Victoria sponge).</p>

            <p>THANK YOU to all the exhibitors who took so much care to grow/make, prepare & present their exhibits. To the volunteers, admin staff & all 3 Alderley allotment sites who worked so well together to get the show up and running again. To our volunteer judges who had such a difficult task & gave up their free time so willingly. To the Parish Council for helping to facilitate the event & to Annette, the Hall Manager, who went above & beyond. To all our visitors for their support & donations to our chosen charity Macmillan Cancer Support. To our local sponsors:  Grantham’s Fine Food & Wines, Beckys Balloons, The Alderley Edge Union Club, Waitrose Alderley Edge & to all those generous individuals who donated raffle prizes & cake to make the show a success. </p>

            <p>As you will be aware our chosen charity for this year was Macmillan Cancer Support it is with our pleasure to confirm the show raised an impressive £1110 pounds for the charity, thank you for all of the donations and support for this great cause.</p>

            <p>Finally, could we offer a very special word of thanks to Mr. Michael Ockelton, the former Chairman of the Village Show & his wife Elaine, who worked tirelessly with the new show committee to ensure the success & future of the Show.</p>
